Engine universal characteristic curve in python

## Environment
Python 3.0.1+  

## Lib
Please use the following command to install the libraries:

pip install Jupyter notebook  
pip install matplotlib  
pip install sklearn

## Data
open data.txt  
Data Format:  
| 1 | engine speed (rpm) | engine torque (N/m) | square of engine speed | product of engine speed and torque | square of engine torque | fuel consumption rate (g/h) |  
Data sources: Internet

## Description
* wan you te xing qu xian.png is based on N15T engine data, not data from data.txt. For confidentiality reasons, I cannot provide the N15T data.
* In the process of drawing the engine external characteristic curve, I try to solve the problem that the equal fuel curve and the equal power curve are beyond the range of the external characteristic curve. But it has not been solved. If there is a way to solve it, or there are other problems that you want to communicate with, please contact me personally at npukujui11@gmail.com.
* Please import data from data.txt into Excel and run it. Only support  Excel import data.
